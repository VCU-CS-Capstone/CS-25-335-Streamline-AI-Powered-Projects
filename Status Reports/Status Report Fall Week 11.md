# Ethan DuBrueler

## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   -  Updated the JSONL file to have the chatbot ask leading questions before giving a recommendation
   -  Added a voice feature where the user can call an AI assistant (ElevenLabs) trained on the sponsor's websites

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   -  mass produce videos using MiniMax

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   - the voice bot costs the same as a human worker ($15/hr of audio) which makes this more of a placeholder than the final product

# David Newman

## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   -  Updated the video generator prototype to only receive image and amenity information directly from Sandals.com.
   -  Currently, multiple videos are possible for each location ranging from featuring value to luxury.

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   -  Implement the higher quality AI voice generation into the code via ChatGPT API. (ChatGPT voiceover sounds super real).
   -  Implement MiniMax API into the Sandals images to convert them to dynamic videos. 

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   -  I'm not a huge fan of the current structure of the AI voiceover video script. The things the video needs to talk about have to be major topics, exciting bullet points, and have to move through each fast.
   -  Once the core features are implemented next week and we have a folder of example videos, we can meet with our sponsor and discuss the structure of the video voiceover script. I want us to aim for the viability of short-form content to be engineered to be attention-grabbing and flashy. (Keep in mind these are designed to be shared on Instagram Reels, Tiktok, Youtube Shorts, etc.)
